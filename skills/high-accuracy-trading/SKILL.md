## Why 33% is Unacceptable

Current performance shows:
- Win: 1 | Loss: 2 | Win Rate: 33%

**Problem:** Strategy is not filtering enough low-quality setups.

## High Win Rate Strategy Framework

### 1. Multi-Confirmation Entry (Need 5/5)

| Filter | Requirement | Why |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| HTF Trend | 4H + Daily aligned | Don't fight the trend |
| Key Level | At S/R + Fibonacci | High probability zones |
| Volume | 1.5x average | Smart money participation |
| RSI | Not overbought/oversold | Avoid reversal risk |
| Pattern | Clean breakout/reversal | Clear signal |

### 2. Risk Management (Strict)

```
- Max Risk: 1% per trade (not 2%)
- R/R Minimum: 1:2.5 (not 1:2)
- Stop: Technical level, not arbitrary %
- Position: Volatility-adjusted
```

### 3. Trade Only A+ Setups

| Setup | Win Rate | Take It? |
|-------|----------|----------|
| All 5 confirmations + momentum | 75%+ | ✅ YES |
| 4/5 confirmations | 55-65% | ⚠️ Maybe |
| 3/5 or less | <50% | ❌ SKIP |

### 4. High Win Rate Strategies

**A. Trend Pullback (70%+)**
- Daily trend clear
- Pullback to 20 EMA
- RSI 40-60 (not extreme)
- Volume on pullback low, on bounce high

**B. Breakout Retest (65%+)**
- Clean breakout of key level
- Retest of broken level as support/resistance
- Volume confirms
- Enter on retest, not breakout

**C. Support/Resistance Flip (68%+)**
- Strong level tested 3+ times
- Price breaks and retests
- Candle close confirmation
- Tight stop below level
